A factor-augmented New Keynesian Phillips Curve proposed by Norkute and Westerlund (2024)[^1], based on the NSYC estimator by Norkutė et al. (2021)[^2], is used to estimate the hybrid NKPC method using Chinese month-on-month provincial inflation data. Two external variables—real estate investment and the output gap—are included. Because the Chinese government does not publish monthly data of compensation of employees and the labour cost index, real margional cost and and the wage inflation at the monthly frequency are not available for the given period. The code provides IV estimates and their corresponding covariance matrices, as well as the overidentifying restriction J-test. The details of the methodology closely follow Norkute and Westerlund (2024). The results do not support the NKPC in the Chinese context.
